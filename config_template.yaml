# === SLURM Configuration ===
# Consult your cluster's documentation if you are unsure about the values below.
job_name: ""
partition: ""
account: ""
qos: ""
cpus_per_node: 32 # cpu is not really needed for our workload.
memory_per_node: "0" # "0" for all available memory per node
gres_per_node: "gpu:4" # Generic resources per node. Examples: "gpu:4", "a100:1", "gpu:h100:8"
time_limit: "24:00:00" # Max walltime on cluster. Jobs are automatically resubmitted if they exceed time limit.
# Additional SBATCH arguments (optional)
additional_sbatch_args:
  # exclude: "node[001-010]"  # Exclude specific nodes


# === Scaling Configuration ===
# The total number of nodes will be num_inference_servers * num_nodes_per_inference_server.
num_inference_servers: 1
num_nodes_per_inference_server: 1 # Increase this only of your model requires more than 1 node per inference server.

# Each inference_server processes one shard of data. For very large datasets you can opt for more shards than inference servers for checkpointing. However, only num_inference_servers shards will be processed in parallel.
# This option can also be useful if you want to continue an incomplete run with a different number of inference servers.
num_data_shards: # leave empty to use num_inference_servers


# === Environment Configuration ===
pixi_manifest: "pixi.toml"  # Path to the pixi manifest file. Edit only if you want to use one of the pre-installed environments (see README.md).
pixi_env: "cuda-vllm"  # Name of the pixi environment to use (see README.md).

  HF_HUB_OFFLINE: "1" # you should download data and model beforehand
  VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE: "1" # multiple vLLM instances on shared filesystem can cause problems


# === Inference Server Configuration ===

# === Health Check Configuration ===
# max_wait_minutes is the maximum time to wait for the API server to become healthy.
# make sure it is reasonable for loading the model. larger models will take longer.
health_check_max_wait_minutes: 10  # Maximum time to wait for API server to become healthy.
health_check_interval_seconds: 20  # Interval between health check attempts


# === API Configuration ===

api_type: "chat-completion"  # "chat-completion" or "completion"
# make sure model is the same as in inference_server_command.

# === Dataset Configuration ===
dataset_type: "hf" # must one of "hf", "hf-disk" or "parquet"
dataset_path: "" # hf identifier or local path
# id_column_name must contain unique string identifiers for each row. The IDs will be used to match responses with input rows.
id_column_name: "id"
# input_column_name must contain strings for completion or messages for chat-completion.

apply_udf: # Can be set to the name of the UDF function in udf.py to apply to the dataset.
